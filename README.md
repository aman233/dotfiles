# dotfiles
Absolute noob when it comes to coding. My .bash_profile uses some prompts on startup and aliases that I find useful, they're the ones I've been using the most as of now.

There is some useful code that I copied to make working with npm easier. Expanding the download limit and file extraction should make it faster to get a download done.


## how to install

git clone this url: https://github.com/aman233/dotfiles.git
